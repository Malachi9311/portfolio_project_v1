        <h1>The story</h1>
        <p>
            As an individual in the community, I would like to have a platform to voice out some of the concerns I have about my immediate environment appropriately, so I can be heard at least.As a person in a community, I would like to be part of something bigger within my environment, so I can connect better and share my surroundings with people, as a people. As a part of my community, I want to also play my part in other people's lives, especially those in my immediate environment, so that i don't need to go too far to get the help i need ask for or perhaps help someone else around me who may need something that i may have the capabilities or means to help with.
